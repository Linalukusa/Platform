Code,Description
002,"Cost of direct materials:
The expenses incurred for direct materials identified in the Schedule may be billed in addition to the procedure code. These expenses are limited to the net acquisition cost of the materials and a handling fee. The price of the materials should be VAT inclusive. Use Modifier 8025 for handling fee."
003,Dental laboratory services:
005,"Procedure accompanied by unusual circumstances:
In exceptional cases where the proposed fee/benefit is disproportionately low in relation to the actual services rendered by a practitioner, such higher fee as may be mutually agreed upon between the dental practitioner and the patient/medical scheme may be billed. Use Modifier 8011 with a narrative description.	
Under certain circumstances a service or procedure is partially reduced or eliminated at the practitioner's election. Under these circumstances a lower fee may be billed. The service provided can be identified by its usual procedure code and the addition of Modifier 8012, signifying the service is reduced."
006,"The schedule does not prescribe the scope of practice of a particular category of Oral Health Care Provider; neither does it confine the performing of procedures or services to a registered speciality. Fees listed within a column of a particular category of Oral Health Care Provider are customary fees, should the procedure or service be rendered by that provider category.
Specialists are however encouraged to confine their practice to the speciality or related specialities in which they are registered. Specialist may charge fees for procedures or services which usually pertain to some other speciality, if such procedures or services are also recognised in their speciality, and if it is carried out only for their bona fide patients. Such fees shall not be higher than those charged by general practitioners for the same procedures or services (HPCSA, Rule 25).
Fees for procedures or services not listed within the column of dental therapists that do fall within the field of dental therapy in terms of their scope of practice are regarded as being “by arrangement” until such fees are listed."
007,Procedures not listed in the Dental Schedule
008,"Oral evaluations and completion of treatment plans:
Oral examinations include an examination, diagnosis and treatment planning (when treatment is required). No further fees/benefits shall be levied for an oral examination (code 8101) or comprehensive examination (code 8102) until the treatment plan resulting from these type of examinations is completed.
The completion of a treatment plan effected from an oral examination and/or comprehensive examination should be indicated by reporting code 8120 – Treatment plan completed.

Oral diagnosis defined.  The determination by the dentist of the oral health condition of an individual patient achieved through the evaluation of data gathered by means of history taking, direct examination, patient conference, and such clinical aids and tests as may be necessary in the judgement of the dentist.

Treatment plan defined.  The treatment plan is the sequential guide for the patient’s care as determined by the dentist’s diagnosis and is used by the dentists for the restoration and/or maintenance of optimal oral health"
009,Surgery guidelines:
nan,"1.	Follow-up care for therapeutic surgical procedures: The fee/benefit for an operation shall, unless otherwise stated, include normal post-operative care for a period not exceeding four months. If a practitioner does not him/herself complete the post-operative care, he/she shall arrange for post-operative care without additional charges. A fee/benefit for post-operative treatment of a prolonged or specialised nature may be charged as agreed upon between the practitioner and the scheme."
nan,"2.	Multiple Procedures (Maxillo-facial and oral surgery):  The fee/benefit for more than one operation or procedure performed through the same incision shall be determined as the fee for the major operation plus fee/benefit for the subsidiary operation to the indicated maximum for each such subsidiary operation or procedure (Modifier 8005). The fee/benefit for more than one operation or procedure performed under the same anaesthetic but through another incision shall be determined on the fee/benefit for the major operation plus: 75% for the second procedure/operation (Modifier 8009). 50% for the third and subsequent procedures/operations (Modifier 8006). This rule shall not apply where two or more unrelated operations are performed by practitioners in different specialities, in which case each practitioner shall be entitled to the full fee/benefit of the operation. If, within four months, a second operation for the same condition or injury is performed, the fee/benefit for the second operation shall be 50% of that of the first operation (Modifier 8006)."
nan,3.	Assistant Surgeon (Maxillo-facial and periodontal surgery): The fee payable to a specialist assistant is determined as 1/3 (of the fee of the practitioner performing the procedure (Modifier 8001). The fee payable to a general dental practitioner assistant is determined as 15% (of the fee of the practitioner performing the procedure (Modifier 8007). The patient must be informed beforehand that another dentist/specialist will be assisting at the operation and that a fee will be payable to the assistant. The assistant's name must appear on the invoice rendered to the patient.
nan,4.	Surgical team (Maxillo-facial and oral surgery): The additional fee to all members of the surgical team for after hours emergency surgery shall be calculated by adding 25% to the fee for the procedure or procedures performed (Modifier 8008).
010,Orthodontic guidelines:
nan,"The documentation and first invoice to the patient/medical scheme regarding orthodontic services will include the following information:_x000D_
a. The treatment plan and type of treatment (treatment code number);_x000D_
b. A diagnostic code (ICD-10) and_x000D_
c. An orthodontic payment plan indicating the following:_x000D_
   i.  The total fee that will be levied for the treatment;_x000D_
   ii.  The total months of orthodontic treatment (retention period excluded);_x000D_
   iii. The initial fee payable by the patient (approximately 20% of the total fee); and_x000D_
   iv. The monthly payments of the balance of the fee."
nan,"2.	The fee for orthodontic treatment does not include a clinical oral evaluation and necessary diagnostic services.  The fee for corrective therapy (i.e. codes 8861 to 8888) is an inclusive fee and no additional fees may be levied for intra-operative oral evaluations and preventive services.  A pre-orthodontic treatment visit, an orthodontic retention, and an oral evaluation on completion of the treatment plan (retention phase included) are excluded and should be reported in addition to corrective orthodontic treatment as separate procedures (Code 8803 x3). Intra/post orthodontic treatment records consisting of radiographs/diagnostic images (limited to a cephalometric film and 5 oral/facial images) and diagnostic casts may be levied when a corrective orthodontic treatment plan is completed (retention phase included)."
nan,"3.	The fee for 'Fixed appliance therapy' (codes 8861 and 8865 to 8888), as determined by the individual practitioner, will be levied on a monthly manner over the treatment period (retention phase excluded)."
nan,"4.	When partial fixed appliance or preliminary orthodontic treatment (codes 8858, 8861, 8865 or 8866) is followed by full fixed appliance orthodontic treatment (codes 8873 to 8888) provided by the same orthodontist, the fees levied for the partial fixed appliance therapy or preliminary treatment will be deducted from the fee quoted for the full fixed appliance orthodontic treatment."
nan,5.	The total fee for multiple phases of full fixed appliance orthodontic treatment provided by the same orthodontist may not exceed the most recent fee (determined on commencement date of the final stage of full fixed appliance treatment) for the appropriate full fixed orthodontic procedure.
nan,"6.	When the patient transfers to another practitioner during treatment, or treatment is terminated for any reason, the original treating practitioner must report the number of treatment months remaining and determine the balance of the fee by applying the following formula: Total payment (for treatment only) minus 20% of the total fee (for banding - when applicable) multiplied by the percentage of treatment remaining. For example, if the practitioner was paid R 10,000.00 for a 24-month treatment plan and 18 months of treatment were completed. The balance would be R 2,000.00 (or R 10,000.00 - R 2,000.00 x 6/24). The length of the treatment plan from the original request for authorisation will be used to determine the number of treatment months remaining. The practitioner continuing treatment will provide the information stipulated in paragraph 1 above. Report code 8891 (Orthodontic transfer) with the fee that will be levied for continuation of the treatment in addition to the appropriate orthodontic treatment code. The fee for continuous treatment is subject to prior authorisation by the patient's medical scheme."
nan,"7.	When an established orthodontic patient requires re-treatment, the information stipulated in paragraph 1 above and the cause(s) for re-treatment will be provided. Report code 8892 (Orthodontic re-treatment) with the fee that will be levied for re-treatment in addition to the appropriate orthodontic treatment code. Orthodontic re-treatment is subject to prior authorisation by the patient's medical scheme."
011,"Dento-legal fees:
Practitioners are entitled to remuneration if they are present at Court at the request of an advocate or attorney. Use code 8111 (Dental testimony) to report dento-legal work. The code is listed in the adjunctive general services sections in the code lists."

Practitioners are entitled to remuneration if they are present at Court at the request of an advocate or attorney. Use code 8111 (Dental testimony) to report dento-legal work. The code is listed in the adjunctive general services sections in the code lists."
012,"Modifiers:
Modifiers should be used with procedures identified throughout the NHRPL.	
Modifiers provide the means by which the reporting practitioner can indicate that a service or procedure that has been performed has been altered by some specific circumstance but not changed it its definition or code. The sensible application of modifiers obviates the necessity for separate procedure listings that may describe the modifying circumstance.  Modifiers may be used to indicate to the recipient of the report that:	
a.	A service or procedure was performed by more than one practitioner.	
b.	A service or procedure has been increased or reduced.	
c.	Only part of a service was performed.	
d.	An adjunctive service was performed.	
e.	A service or procedure was provided more than once.	
f.	The fee/benefit was altered due to a financial agreement."
