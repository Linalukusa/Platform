Where prolonged personal professional attention is necessary for the well-being and safety of such patient, the necessary time will be valued on the same basis as indicated above for the anaesthetic time.  The anaesthesiologist/anaesthetist must show on his/her account the exact anaesthetic time, including the supervision time spent with the patient.

When the basic anaesthetic units for the procedure is 3,00, one extra anaesthetic unit should be added. If the basic anaesthetic units for the procedure is 4,00 or more, no extra units should be added
0033, Participating in general care of patients: When an anaesthesiologist/anaesthetist is required to participate in the general care of a patient during a surgical procedure, but does not administer the anaesthetic, such services may be remunerated at full anaesthetic rate, subject to the provisos of modifier 0035: Anaesthetic administered by an anaesthesiologist/anaesthetist. and modifier 0036: Anaesthetic administered by general practitioners.
0034, Head and neck procedures: All anaesthetics administered for diagnostic, surgical or X-ray procedures on the head and neck shall have a minimum of 4,00 basic anaesthetic units.
